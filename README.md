uber clone using react and node.js

This app is specifically for android (due to the lack of swift) and has two components: the driverside app and the passengerside app. 
As for the backend, the server is hosted in the node.js environment.

To test the driver code, use the pusher app to push data for drivers. 
To test the passenger code, connect your android device to the computer and run: 
react-native run-android
